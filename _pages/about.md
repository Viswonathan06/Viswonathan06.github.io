I am a Master's student in Computer Science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, with a strong background in machine learning, fairness-aware AI, and large language models. My research focuses on developing fair and robust machine learning systems, with particular emphasis on bias mitigation in personality computing and multi-modal learning.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on **fairness-aware machine learning** and **large language model alignment**. I am particularly interested in:

- **Bias Mitigation in Multi-modal ML Models**: Developing novel fairness loss functions and neural architecture search methods to improve generalization across demographic groups
- **Personality Computing**: Building personalized models for automatic personality recognition using deep learning architectures  
- **LLM Evaluation and Alignment**: Evaluating and improving fairness, robustness, and safety of large language models across multiple languages
- **Multi-Persona Debate Simulation**: Creating frameworks to assess environmental and ethical alignment in LLMs

My work combines deep learning, neural architecture search, and fairness metrics to address bias and improve model generalization in real-world applications.
