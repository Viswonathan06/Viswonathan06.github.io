Evaluated alignment methods for large language models (phi-4, Llama3-8B, and tinyroberta) across 10+ languages, focusing on fairness, robustness, and safety. Employed SFT (Supervised Fine-Tuning) fine-tuning leading to ~15% increase in accuracy across selected languages for each model.

**Technologies:** Python, PyTorch, HuggingFace Transformers, Multi-lingual NLP, SFT Fine-tuning

**Key Achievements:**
- Evaluated LLMs across 10+ languages
- Achieved ~15% accuracy improvement through SFT fine-tuning
- Focused on fairness, robustness, and safety metrics
